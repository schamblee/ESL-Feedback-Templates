# 5 Apple Feedback

Lesson feedback generator for [VIPKID ESL teachers](https://t.vipkid.com.cn/activity/popup?refereeId=4057772&refersourceid=a01). Stores student and creates custom feedback templates to save teachers time writing their feedback.

## Motivation

As an online ESL (English as a second language) teacher for [VIPKID](https://t.vipkid.com.cn/activity/popup?refereeId=4057772&refersourceid=a01), I often have to re-write lesson feedback after each class. I store my feedback in an excel spreadsheet, but I wanted something easier to use to offer other teachers. 5 Apple Feedback stores well-cradted lesson feedback that is custom-written for each VIPKID lesson. The app uses the provided student information to tailor the feedback to the student.
